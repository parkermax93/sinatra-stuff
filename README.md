Sinatra Portfolio Project

This is the game completion project! Show others what games you have currently completed by adding them to the list of games shown! This will be a database of games that you have completed and enjoyed for future reccomendations from other gamers like yourself! 

Installation To install this program, clone the repository from https://github.com/parkermax93/sinatra-stuff, then run 'bundle install' in the terminal.

Usage The user must first create a signup profile that includes a unique email, username, and password. From the signup page, the user will automatically be routed to the game index. Once an account is created, they can go to the sign in side instead. From the index page, the user will see all games listed by all users. They will also be able to add a new game to the database from the index page which can only be edited or deleted by the original user who added it to the database.

Development After checking out the repo, run bin/setup to install dependencies. You can also run bin/console for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run bundle exec rake install. To release a new version, update the version number in version.rb, and then run bundle exec rake release, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the .gem file to rubygems.org.
